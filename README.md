# nomad-kranksvm
This is an asynchronous distibuted method used to improve the training speed of large-scale kernel ranksvm. In fact , such an algorithm can be executed in both shared-memory and distributed systems. Notice that if executing it on a distributed system, the commnication costs can be hidden effectively because the bulk synchrinization can be well avoided.
